// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

const names: string[]=["Ahzam", "Zacki", "Asad", "Ahsan"];
console.log("It's nice to meet you Mr",names[0],". I hope you are in a good health.");
